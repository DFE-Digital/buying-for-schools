<h2 id="assess">Assess what you currently have</h2>

<ul>
  <li>what services you use</li>

  <li>what resources you actually use</li>
  <li>how much you’re currently paying</li>

<h2>Savings</h2>
{{ govukWarningText({
  text: 'If you’re buying books and materials over a longer term, make sure they are high quality and will meet your future curriculum requirements.',
  iconFallbackText: 'Warning'
}) }}


<p>If you’re buying in bulk or purchasing a class set of books, check whether publishers can offer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>free books</li>
  <li>additional services that add value</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also get discounts on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>bulk orders for your MAT or other local schools</li>
  <li>top up orders for lost or damaged books</li>
  <li>digital subscriptions</li>
  <li>longer-term subscriptions </li>
</ul>


<h3>Fees</h3>
<p>Before you buy, you should be aware of fees for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>book-jacketing</li>
  <li>delivery </li>
  <li>delayed or missed payments</li>
</ul>

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>Getting your books may take longer if you need to order from different suppliers.</p>

<p>Before you buy, consider whether you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>want your orders in the same order and at the same time</li>
  <li>need different suppliers</li>
  <li>can access materials in different formats, such as e-books</li>
</ul>

<h2>Find the right way to buy</h2>
{{ govukWarningText({
    text: 'Follow your school’s procurement rules. These may be your school’s own rules, or set by the local authority.',
    iconFallbackText: 'Warning'
}) }}
<p>The option you choose will depend on your school requirements and circumstances. The DfE has also put together <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/buying-for-schools">guidance and templates</a> to support you.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to buy books and educational resources. Here are 3 suggestions of how to achieve best value:</p>
<ul>
  <li>use a framework</li>
  <li>compare prices across catalogues or third party suppliers</li>
  <li>negotiate with publishers</li>
</ul>

<h3>Use a framework</h3>

<div class="call-to-action">
  <p>DfE reviews a range of frameworks. These are assessed for compliance with procurement regulations, ease of use, suitability and value for money.</p>

  <p><a rel="external" href="/">Find a DfE recommended framework for your school</a></p>
</div>
 
<p>You may want to use framework agreements because they:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help you run competitions across multiple suppliers</li>
  <li>have already been through a full competitive tender process</li>
  <li>have been quality checked</li>
  <li>are checked to make sure they comply with the law</li>
  <li>may have draft specifications and help available</li>
  <li>offer significant discounts</li>
  <li>are free to use</li>
  <li>give you access to discounted specialist school services</li>
  <li>offer free support with the buying process </li>
</ul>
<p>You can find out more details about the books and materials frameworks on our <a href="/framework">recommended framework list</a>.</p>

<h3>Compare prices across catalogues or third party suppliers</h3>
<p>You may want to compare prices if your order is urgent or complex.</p>

<p>You can compare prices using:</p>
<ul>
  <li>catalogues online or in print</li>
  <li>an educational trade supplier recommended by the <a href="https://www.besa.org.uk/">British Education Suppliers Association (BESA)</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some catalogues can save you time through the use of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>shared baskets across the school</li>
  <li>advising you of special offers</li>
  <li>free book jacketing service</li>
  <li>payment methods linked with your school finance system </li>
  <li>sharing recommendations for suitable resources, reading schemes or class book sets</li>
</ul>

<h3>Negotiate with publishers</h3>

<p>Publishers can offer you help with buying books while still giving you discounts. It’s a good idea to compare what they’re offering to help you make the most suitable purchase.</p>

<h3>Discounts</h3>
<p>Many publishers regularly run offers on popular products such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>discounts on various titles </li>
  <li>special offers on quantities, such as 3 for 2 offers</li>
</ul>

<p>Most publishers will help you save by aggregating purchases and costs on your behalf across different MATs and schools in the local authority.</p>

<p>Schools are also able to get reductions in costs and subscription fees if a school is making multiple purchases. It’s useful to keep track of what each department in the school is buying and whether multiple subscriptions already exist.</p>

<p>When investing in a coherent curriculum programme, you can secure discounts for future top ups of books.</p>
