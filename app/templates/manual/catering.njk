  {{ govukWarningText({
    text: 'Make sure you’re familiar with the School Food Standards requirements.',
    iconFallbackText: 'Warning'
  }) }}

  <h3 id="current-contract">Current contract</h3>

  <p>Start to think about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the service you’re paying for currently</li>
    <li>what you want to change or improve</li>
    <li>whether you’ll need to make a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-for-schools/before-you-start">business case</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="moving-to-a-new-contract">Moving to a new contract</h3>

  <p>Gather the information you’ll need before you move contracts, such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>expiry date of current agreement and notice period</li>
    <li>the likely value of your contract</li>
    <li>current uptake of free school meals</li>
    <li>total school meal uptake</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="planning-timescales">Planning timescales</h2>

  <p>Rushing procurement may cost you more time and money.</p>

  <p>Moving your contract make take longer than you think.</p>

  <h3 id="when-to-start-a-new-contract">When to start a new contract</h3>

  <p>Try to start a new contract:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>at the beginning of a new academic year</li>
    <li>at the beginning of new financial year</li>
    <li>after a significant holiday period such as Christmas or Easter</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="approval-time">Approval time</h3>
  
  <p>Allow decision-making time with governors and trustees.</p>
  
  <p>You may find it easier to work backwards from your switch date to plan each stage of the process.</p>
  
  <h3 id="keep-people-informed">Keep people informed</h3>
  
  <p>Talk regularly to your staff. These are the people most likely to be affected by any change.</p>
  
  <p>Try to reduce any concerns and be aware that staff may want to contact their union.</p>
  
  <h3 id="tupe-considerations">TUPE considerations</h3>
  
  <p>Consider whether <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transfers-takeovers">TUPE</a> or Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) will apply to your school, especially if you’re looking to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>outsource provisions</li>
    <li>move away from your local authority for the first time</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>When you give notice of termination to your current provider, you
  should request details of any staff that will be subject to TUPE transfer.</p>
  
  <p>This information should include:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>salary</li>
    <li>terms and conditions</li>
    <li>pension details</li>
  </ul>

  
  <p>These details will form part of your business case and potential tender
  requirements.</p>

  <h2 id="research">Research</h2>
  
  <h3 id="talk-to-stakeholders">Talk to stakeholders</h3>
  
  <p>Consider what your pupils, parents, staff, governors and trustees want. This will help you deliver successful catering provision.</p>
  
  <h3 id="talk-to-other-schools">Talk to other schools</h3>
  
  <p>You may want to contact local schools to see if they’re looking to renew or change contracts.</p>
  
  <p>You may be able to combine provisions to:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>get better value for money</li>
    <li>save time by splitting the workload</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="find-the-right-way-to-buy">Find the right way to buy</h2>
  
  <p>Follow your school’s procurement rules. These may be your school’s own rules, or set by the local authority.</p>
  
  <p>You have 3 options:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#use-a-framework">use a framework</a></li>
    <li><a href="#run-your-own-procurement">run your own procurement</a></li>
    <li><a href="#in-house-catering">in-house catering</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The option you choose will depend on your school requirements and circumstances.</p>
  
  <p>If the lifetime value of your contract is over the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-for-schools/buying-things-that-are-over-the-eu-procurement-threshold">EU Procurement threshold</a>, you’ll need to use a framework agreement or carry out your own procurement, issuing an OJEU tender.</p>

  <h3 id="use-a-framework">Use a framework</h3>
  
  <p>DfE reviews a range of frameworks. These are assessed for compliance with procurement regulations, ease of use, suitability and value for money.</p>
  
  <div class="call-to-action">
  <p><a rel="external" href="https://buying-for-schools-prototype.herokuapp.com/service/start">Find a DfE recommended framework for your school</a></p>
  </div>
  
  <p>Buying from a framework can be quicker and easier than getting bids or quotes because the agreements:</p>
  <ul>  
    <li>have already been through a full competitive tender process</li>
    <li>have been quality checked</li>
    <li>are checked to make sure they comply with the law</li>
    <li>may have draft specifications and expert help available</li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="equipment">Equipment</h4>
  
  <p>You should consider:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>what equipment you own</li>
    <li>what the bidding suppliers will provide</li>
    <li>if you’ll have to buy new equipment and costs involved</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h5 id="potential-suppliers">Potential suppliers</h5>
  
  <p>When choosing suppliers, consider:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>confirming that DBS checks have been completed</li>
    <li>inviting suppliers to your school to produce sample meals</li>
    <li>getting feedback on suppliers by talking to other schools they provide for</li>
  </ul>


  <h3 id="run-your-own-procurement">Run your own procurement</h3>
  
  <p>If you cannot get what you need through a framework, you can run your own buying process.</p>
  
  <p>You should consider if:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>maintenance contracts are covered by existing contractors</li>
    <li>contractor tests and checks are up to date</li>
    <li>you need to replace equipment because it belongs to the current provider</li>
    <li>DBS checks have been completed by suppliers</li>
    <li>staff training is required such as food hygiene and food preparation skills</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="moving-away-from-local-authority-provision">Moving away from local authority provision</h4>
  
  <p>There may be timeframes around when the local authority is obliged to release TUPE and LGPS information.</p>
  
  <p>These timeframes can cause delays and further expense if you award the contract without having these details.</p>
  
  <p>You may want to invite your local authority to tender and involve them in the process. This way the information you need is provided during the bidding process.</p>

  <h3 id="in-house-catering">In-house catering</h3>
  
  <p>You may decide to take your catering provision in-house and hire your own staff to carry out your requirements.</p>
  
  <h4 id="equipment-1">Equipment</h4>
  
  <p>You may want to consider:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>what equipment you’ll need</li>
    <li>potential maintenance costs</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="staff-training">Staff training</h4>
  
  <p>You may want to consider initial training for your staff such as:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>food specification</li>
    <li>menu building</li>
    <li>health and safety</li>
    <li>food preparation</li>
    <li>food hygiene standards</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="costs">Costs</h4>
  
  <p>Double check your figures and requirements – a miscalculated business plan can be costly.</p>
  
  <p>You may want to consider whether costs will increase for:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>staff</li>
    <li>food</li>
    <li>utility bills</li>
    <li>ongoing staff training for changes in qualifications and regulations</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="capacity">Capacity</h4>
  
  <p>You may want to consider whether you can accommodate increased uptake for school meals. This may include additional:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>staff hours</li>
    <li>equipment</li>
    <li>dining space</li>
    <li>produce</li>
    <li>storage</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h4 id="opportunities">Opportunities</h4>
  
  <p>You may find you can:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>offer catering services to other local schools and generate additional income</li>
    <li>negotiate better prices from suppliers</li>
    <li>increase food quality</li>
    <li>respond quicker if your equipment is broken or faulty</li>
    <li>develop staff skills through bespoke training</li>
    <li>be in control of your expenditure</li>
  </ul>
