        <p class="govuk-body">Before you can use the framework, you need to <a href="https://www.espo.org/Registration" class="govuk-link">create a MyESPO account</a> and fill in the customer access agreement form.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">All the forms you need are in the downloads section of the <a href="https://www.espo.org/Frameworks/Libraries/Books-and-Related-Materials" class="govuk-link">framework page on the ESPO website</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Find out suppliers’ discount rates</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Rates are listed by publishers on page 8 of the user guide to help you identify suppliers who offer the best discounts.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you do not know the publisher of the books you need, visit any of the suppliers’ websites (page 12 of the user guide) and search by book title or ISBN.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Run a further competition between the suppliers</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">If you think you can get a better price, you can run a mini-competition. This usually only applies to items ordered in large quantities.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Contact your chosen supplier</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should contact your chosen supplier to confirm availability, delivery times and pricing – the quote should reflect the discount from the recommended retail price (RRP) stated within the user guide.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can find contact details of all suppliers on page 6 of the user guide.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Place your order with the chosen supplier</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">There are two ways you can place your order:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>using the template order form</li>
        <li>by telephone or email</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="govuk-body">You must quote ‘ESPO Framework 376E’ to get the agreed discounts.</p>
